    <h1>Name</h1>
    <p>Warami Eresanara</p>
    <h1>Personal summary</h1>
    <p>Experienced Program Coordinator with a demonstrated history of working in the non-profit organization management industry. Strong community and social services professional skilled in Nonprofit Organizations, Microsoft Word, Public Speaking, Teamwork,
        and Leadership. </p>
    <h1>Why I applied to decagon</h1>
    <p>Software development is such an important, ever growing and ever-changing industry. It’s an industry I’ve grown to be passionate about over the last few months and the opportunity to participate in the Decagon Program would be the foundation that
        I need to transition into this new career path. While working I had the opportunity to help launch a software company and product. Working on this launch brought my attention to the importance of software design and the positive effect it could
        have on the African economy. This led me to start taking coding classes online with the Google, Andela, and Pluralsight program, all in an effort to learn more about the software space. The Lambda school would help build the right competence level
        that I need to succeed in this field. The program will provide for me a community where I can be in contact with other individuals on a similar journey. It will give me access to information and resources; such as the latest and most up to date
        technology and frameworks for building great products solutions. Also, it will provide me the opportunity to begin my career as a software engineer with a respected technology company.
