        <h5>WHY I APPLIED TO DECAGON</h5>
        <p>
            <span> Software development is such an important, ever-growing and ever-changing industry. 
            It’s an industry I’ve grown to be passionate about over the last few months. 
            I choose to apply to the Decagon program because I knew it will be the foundation that I need to transition into this new career path. 
          </span>
            <span>
              While working I had the opportunity to help launch a software company and product. 
              Working on this launch brought my attention to the importance of software design and the positive effect it could have on the African economy. 
              This led me to start taking coding classes online to learn more about the software space. 
          </span>
            <span>
              The Decagon program will help build the right competence level that I need to succeed in this field. 
              The program will provide for me a community where I can be in contact with other individuals on a similar journey. It will give me access to information and resources; such as the latest and most up to date technology and frameworks for building great product solutions. 
              Also, it will provide me the opportunity to begin my career as a software engineer with a respected technology company.
          </span>
